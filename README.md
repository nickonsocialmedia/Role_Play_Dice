DICE / Random Generation / For Vertual Roll Playing


Today I’m BIGMOUTH.
Named for obvious reasons.

What I make up for in social skills I lack in raw technical firepower. I don’t pretend otherwise. I run a basic framework. Lightweight. Portable. Remote access when I need it. Nothing fancy. Nothing worth noticing.

People think hacking is about machines.
It isn’t. It’s about momentum.


## BIGMOUTH: HUMAN VECTOR

I get the call after I’m already gone.

That’s how I know it’s real.

No voicemail. No missed call. Just a number that knows I’ll answer.

“So BIGMOUTH. You think you can do it?”

I let the silence sit. Silence is part of the price.

I’ve been doing black hat ops since I was thirteen.
Don’t try this if you’ve only been doing this for a few years.
Actually don’t try this at all.

Richard a russian man with little to know assent talks like a man who already knows the answer but ... Risky deals. Competitive pressure. A subsidiary that might be doing things it shouldn’t. He doesn’t say the word laundering. He doesn’t have to.

MISSION: 

Find out if it’s true.
And if it is get the money.


4 million in a duffel bag?

make it 6?

Silence on the line. Not the bad kind. The thinking kind.

“Make it six,” he says.
I don’t correct him. He already did it himself.

6 million in a duffle bag to catch a thief.
Piece of cake for the great BIGMOUTH.

Thank god no one can hear me when I say that. I’d sound insane.



By the time I’m sitting in the rented flat the hard part is already over.

That’s what amateurs never understand.
The border isn’t where the risk is.
The risk is who notices you before you move.

Everything else happened off screen. Through favors. Timing. People who don’t ask follow up questions. I didn’t invent anything new. I didn’t need to.

Result success with complications

I look the part now mostly. Light pin striped jacket. Sunglasses I don’t need. Shoes that definitely don’t say bank. Skinny jeans. High tops. Nobody expects the thing they’re actually looking at.

I don’t look like a banker.
I look like someone who talks to bankers.

That’s better.

Tomorrow I’m onboarding as a Business Systems Liaison at a mid sized bank with a name that sounds trustworthy and forgettable. Corporate for professional middleman with a calendar and a tolerance for nonsense.

Hybrid role.
Lots of meetings.
Just enough access to be useful.
Not enough to be dangerous on paper.

I skim the orientation emails on my new enterprise account while the minibar sweats onto the desk.

Process alignment.
Stakeholder visibility.
Documentation best practices.

I smile.

I don’t run systems.
I don’t touch ledgers.
I don’t accuse anyone of anything.

I just talk.


BIGMOUTH doesn’t kick doors in. He sends emails.

Not the kind you screenshot.
The kind you reply to.

Level one is invisible. The people nobody thinks of as targets because they don’t think of themselves that way either.

Level two is professional. we want to control his whole world. anyone who the target may have connection too in his professional life.

Level three is personal. Family. close relatives.

No scripts.
No templates.
Just tone and timing.

Tomorrow morning I start listening.

Somewhere someone is already nervous.
They just don’t know why yet.

To be continued ...
